# ChatApplication2023
For our project we decided to work on a client-server chat application. The server routes messages between clients. Clients can send messages to a public room, or send private messages to other clients. This was done in C. final_project_client.c servers as the code for the clients for the application, while final_project_server.c handles the server, actiong as the middleman. Final Project Report.docx is a document explaining the different aspects of the program.
